1. 3D_annihil_Grid.py:
Map the coordinates of the positron annihilation positions in the GATE simulation (annihilation file) to a three-dimensional voxel grid (annihilationgrid) to count the spatial distribution of annihilation positions, that is, to construct a positron annihilation density map.

2. PoistronRange.py:
For processing and analyzing PET simulation dataï¼šRead particle trajectory data from GATE simulation output, clean and organize raw data, calculate positron range distribution, perform spatial distribution statistics, and analyze distribution characteristics using fitting functions
