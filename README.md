# Perfection-of-PET-with-CNN

1. Phantom.mac:
 
 This macro file mainly imports the phantom image (mu-map / attenuation map) generated by Python into GATE, assigns geometric materials, and defines its position in space, resolution, and how to save its mu value (linear attenuation coefficient) distribution. It is the basis for building the physical environment of the entire PET simulation.
 
 Explaination of some code:
 /gate/LungPhantom/geometry/setRangeToMaterialFile /home/gateuser/sim/AttenuationConv.dat : Convert different pixel values ​​(HU) in the image to material labels (e.g. Lung, Water)
